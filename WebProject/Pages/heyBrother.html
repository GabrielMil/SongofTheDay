                    <b>About Avicii and "Hey Brother":</b><br />
                    Avicii was inspired for this song from the movie "Brother, Where Art Thou?"
                    <br />
                    This video depicts two brothers growing up in wartime America.The video shows clips and pics of the Vietnam War... At the end, it is revealed that the younger boy thought of his father who died in the  as the older brother he never had.
                    <br />
                    The somg Hey Brother is about a boy growing up in wartime and his dad died during the Vietnam War and he was imagining his dad as a boy about his age and his dad as the older brother who is very protective over him. Thats why the phase " There's an endless road to re-discover" is used because he'll never forget his dad. Also the phrase " If I'm far from home" was used to show that his dad was far and was never going to come back. "Know the water's sweet but blood it thicker" was used to show the mutual bond between the two. That's the true meaning even Avicii said himself ,eventhough alot of people get confused over it.
