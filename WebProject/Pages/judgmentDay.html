                    [Verse 1]<br />
                    I can feel the floor shaking<br />
                    And the glass begin to break<br />
                    The air is getting thinner<br />
                    With every breath that I take<br />
                    The calm before the storm<br />
                    You could hear the drop of a pin<br />
                    Never been claustrophobic<br />
                    But now the walls are closing in<br />
                    <br />
                    [Pre-Chorus]<br />
                    I've crossed every line<br />
                    Broken every boundary<br />
                    And now it's retribution time<br />
                    'Cause the church that I went to<br />
                    It ain't that holy<br />
                    <br />
                    [Chorus]<br />
                    So strike me down, take me away<br />
                    Debts are due, it's time to pay<br />
                    Face what I deserve<br />
                    Here comes judgment day<br />
                    I won't run, the guilt is mine<br />
                    Too long denying all my crimes<br />
                    Face what I deserve<br />
                    Here comes judgment day<br />
                    <br />
                    [Verse 2]<br />
                    All the love I have taken<br />
                    All the hearts I've turned to hate<br />
                    Hearts are easily broken when you've been made in the shade<br />
                    Crossed every line, broken every boundary<br />
                    And now it's retribution time<br />
                    'Cause the church that i went to<br />
                    It ain't that holy<br />
                    <br />
                    [Chorus]<br />
                    Strike me down, take me away<br />
                    Debts are due, it's time to pay<br />
                    Face what I deserve, here comes judgment day<br />
                    I won't run, the guilt is mine<br />
                    Too long denying all my crimes<br />
                    Face what I deserve, here comes judgment day<br />
                    <br />
                    [Bridge]<br />
                    Standing at the gate<br />
                    Ready to meet my fate<br />
                    Cleanse my soul it's not too late<br />
                    So bring on judgment day<br />
                    <br />
                    [Chorus]<br />
                    Strike me down, take me away<br />
                    Debts are due, it's time to pay<br />
                    Face what I deserve, here comes judgment day<br />
                    I won't run, the guilt is mine<br />
                    Too long denying all my crimes<br />
                    Face what I deserve, here comes judgment day

                    <b>In the interview Stealth was asked about his video to the song, this what he answered:</b><br />
                    “The whole concept was supposed to be about battling with your own conscience – it’s about whether you should admit to something and take the wrap for what you’ve done or listen to the bad part of your conscience and carry on misbehaving and kind of lying. It was the battle between the consciences. That’s why it’s set in the church; it’s obviously such a big cavernous place and it really fit well with the song. We were a bit worried that it might look cliché but at the same time, it couldn’t have been anywhere else. Amy, the dancer who I actually grew up with as a kid, she’s fantastic. She really managed to capture exactly what I wanted. I didn’t give her any direction; she choreographed it herself so she was amazing.”
